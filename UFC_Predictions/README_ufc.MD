# UFC fight winner prediction by Matthew Grace

In this github folder, I have a notebook where I have worked on and am continuing to work on (unless specified), creating a model
to predict winners of UFC fights. While I am starting out using a dataset from Kaggle in order to build these models, future work may include models to maximize profits for bets placed on fights using lines set by oddsmakers.

This folder contains the data from source at https://www.kaggle.com/mdabbert/ultimate-ufc-dataset, Jupyter notebook where data cleaning, preprocessing, feature engineering, and model building is conducted, and a saved neural network model hierarchical data format (.h5).
